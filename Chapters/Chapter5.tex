\chapter{Results and Discussion}


Future work would be to:
1. Combine states/ gait states , or have a first level classification of what state the pedestrian is : like stopping, starting, running, walking. 
2. A model that takes in as input the head pose orientation of the walking pedestrian
3. A system that talks with other identified components and contextual features 

About the window size.
About having a mechanism where more weight-age is given to the last point in the trajectory. 
About modelling uncertainty and thus getting better results
