\chapter{Problem Formulation and Evaluation}

\section{Problem Formulation}
Given spatial locations \( \{x_i^t, y_i^t\} \) for tracked pedestrians \(i = 1, 2, ... N\) from time steps \(t = 1, ..., T_{obs} \), predict their future locations \( \{\hat{x_i}^t, \hat{y_i}^t\} \) from \(t = T_{obs} + 1, ... T_{pred}\)

\section{Evaluation}
Different metrics were considered during evaluation. 
\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item Mean Euclidean Distance
    \cite{goldhammer_pedestrians_2014}
    Between the estimated points \( P_{est}(x_{est},y_{est})\) along the \((x,y)\)-plane and the tracked head center positions which serve as ground truth \((P_{gt}(x_{gt}, y_{gt})\). MED sums up over all \(p\) predictions for one fixed forecasting horizon:
    \[ MED = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p} \sqrt{(x_{est,i}-x_{GT,i})^2 + (y_{est,i}-y_{GT,i})^2} \]
    
    \item Two-Dimensional Root Mean Square Deviation
    \cite{goldhammer_camera_2015}
    The \(RMS_{2D}\) is defined for all \(p\) predictions in the test data with a specific predicted time step \(t_{pred} \) as
    \[ RMSD_{2D}(t_{pred}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^{p}(x_{pred}(i)-x_{GT}(i))^2+(y_{pred}(i)-y_{GT}(i))^2}\]
    with \((x_{pred},y_{pred})\) being the predicted and \((x_{GT},y_{GT})\) being the ground truth position
    \item ASAEE (Average Specific Average Euclidean Error) \cite{goldhammer_intentions_2018}
    \[ ASAEE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{AEE(t_{pred(i)})}{t_{pred(i)}}  \]
    \item Mean Squared Error
    Also the same as Mean Euclidean Distance (MED), Average Euclidean Error(AEE)
    
    \item Final Displacement Error
    %\[FDE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{}}{n}\]
\end{enumerate}


Finally, Mean Euclidean Error was considered as the final metric of evaluation, as this was the standard metric used between different papers.
